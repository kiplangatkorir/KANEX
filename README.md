### KANEX: KAN-based Express Model
**KANEX (Kolmogorov-Arnold Network Express Model)** is a lightweight and efficient language model based on Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs). Despite its compact size, KANEX is designed to be highly expressive and capable of handling a variety of natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including text generation. Built with the goal of minimizing computational complexity, it integrates KAN-based attention mechanisms to offer scalable performance while remaining suitable for devices with limited resources, such as laptops or free-tier cloud GPUs.

## Key Features:

**KAN-based Attention:** Utilizes Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks for efficient and powerful attention mechanisms, offering O(n log n) complexity.

**Small and Efficient:** Designed to be highly resource-friendly, allowing training on Wikipedia data with limited hardware like a free Colab GPU.

**Scalable:** The hierarchical structure enables performance on NLP tasks like document summarization, question answering, and more.

**Memory Efficient:** Optimized for long-sequence tasks with enhanced memory efficiency, using techniques like gradient checkpointing.

## Applications:
Text Generation

Document Summarization

Long-Form Question Answering

Text Classification

Language Understanding

## How It Works:

KANEX leverages the Kolmogorov-Arnold Theorem to approximate complex functions through hierarchical and multi-head local attention. This allows the model to efficiently manage both computational and memory resources, while maintaining high performance on NLP tasks.
